<p>IN CONSIDERATION OF the undertakings and mutual covenants contained herein, the Parties hereto now agree as follows:</p>
<h2 id="1-scope-of-the-agreement"><a href="../../customer_agreement/index.html#1-scope-of-the-agreement" class="yfm-anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a><strong>1. SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT</strong></h2>
<p>1.1. DoubleCloud will grant Customer access to and the right to use the Services, and Customer shall use and pay for the Services in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p>1.2. To access and use the Services, Customer shall comply with the Linked Documents, which are integral parts hereof.</p>
<p>1.3. Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement does not grant either Party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the other's Content or to any of the other's intellectual property rights.</p>
<h2 id="2-modifications"><a href="../../customer_agreement/index.html#2-modifications" class="yfm-anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a><strong>2. MODIFICATIONS</strong></h2>
<p>2.1. DoubleCloud may unilaterally modify the terms of this Agreement, including pricing and any attached or Linked Documents, from time to time, in the manner stipulated herein.</p>
<p>2.2. DoubleCloud will notify Customer at least 30 days prior to any modifications to this Agreement, including pricing and any attached or Linked Documents, becoming effective, except where the changes apply to new technical functionalities of the Services or new Services which DoubleCloud is generally always entitled to introduce and which shall become effective immediately upon posting on the Site, without prior notification.</p>
<p>2.3. DoubleCloud will notify Customer of any modifications to this Agreement via the Management Console or by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address registered by Customer.</p>
<p>2.4. If Customer does not agree with any modifications to this Agreement and/or Linked Documents, Customer may terminate this Agreement by sending a written notice of termination via email to DoubleCloud's e-mail address indicated on the Site or Management Console within 30 days from the effective date of DoubleCloud's notice. After the expiry of 30 days without such termination notice, such absence of termination notice will be deemed acceptance of the modified terms by Customer.</p>
<h2 id="3-trial-period"><a href="../../customer_agreement/index.html#3-trial-period" class="yfm-anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a><strong>3. TRIAL PERIOD</strong></h2>
<p>3.1. DoubleCloud may, on a case-by-case basis, decide to provide Customer with a Trial Period to test the Services free of charge. Such Trial Period will be limited by the duration and extent of the usage rights granted by DoubleCloud. DoubleCloud may also post information about the duration and extent of the usage rights granted during the Trial Period on the Site or will notify Customer via the Management Console or e-mail.</p>
<p>3.2. DoubleCloud may keep records of Customer's use of Services to determine when the Trial Period ends (when the granted usage rights expire).</p>
<p>3.3. If Customer continues to access and use the Services after expiry of the Trial Period, this will be deemed Customer's acceptance of the paid version of the Services in accordance with the terms hereof. Customer may switch to the paid version of the Services before the Trial Period ends by adjusting the respective settings in the Management Console. In this case, any Credit that is unused during the Trial Period shall be retained and the fees for Services in the paid version shall be reduced for Customer accordingly. In any case, a Credit provided during the Trial Period is limited to the duration of the Trial Period set for Customer and is forfeited thereafter.</p>
<p>3.4. Before access to the paid version of the Services is granted, DoubleCloud may ask Customer to furnish additional documents and information confirming the accuracy of Customer's details provided during the initial sign-up procedure. In case of failure to submit any additionally requested documents and information, DoubleCloud may suspend Customer's access to any or all of the Services.</p>
<p>3.5. DoubleCloud may at any time limit, technically and functionally, usage of the Services granted within the Trial Period. For the avoidance of doubt, the Service Levels specified in the SLA will not apply to the Trial Period.</p>
<h2 id="4-services-access-and-management"><a href="../../customer_agreement/index.html#4-services-access-and-management" class="yfm-anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a><strong>4. SERVICES ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT</strong></h2>
<p>4.1. To access the Platform and Services, Customer shall open a unique account on the Platform associated with a valid e-mail address.</p>
<p>4.2. Upon registration, Customer shall provide accurate and complete information requested in the registration form and shall keep such information updated. Should Customer provide inaccurate information or should DoubleCloud have reason to believe that any information provided by Customer is incomplete or inaccurate, DoubleCloud may, as it sees fit, block or delete Customer's account or deny Customer access to the Platform and will inform Customer about any such action and the reasons for it via the Management Console or by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address registered by Customer.</p>
<p>4.3. Customer shall promptly notify DoubleCloud of any instances of unauthorized User access to DoubleCloud services and/or any actual or presumed breach of confidentiality of the chosen means of access to the Management Console.</p>
